# Hello World

A basic showcase of interacting with the Prism SDK.

This demo uses the NPM package `@patientprism/snippet-sdk`. To install this in your own project, use `npm install --save-dev @patientprism/snippet-sdk`

If you want to test with your own Code Snippet, replace the `<script>` tag for the snippet in the `index.html` file for this demo.
